Self explanatory. 
# NOTE!
The checkra1n jailbreak, at least right now, is not free open source software. The developers have said they plan to open source it,
but don't expect it to be soon. if you have your ACCEPT_LICENSE="@FREE", see https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.license
if you don't know how to add exceptions to licenses.
