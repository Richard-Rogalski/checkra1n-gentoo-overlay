# checkra1n-gentoo-overlay
Installs the checkra1n ELF to your system path
# NOTE!
The checkra1n jailbreak, at least right now, is not free open source software. The developers have said they plan to open source it,
but don't expect it to be soon. if you have your ACCEPT_LICENSE="@FREE", see https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.license
if you don't know how to add exceptions to licenses. 

checkra1n is beta software, use it at your own risk.

If there's a new version of checkra1n available but not yet included in this overlay, feel free to open an issue to remind me.

## Thanks to Hu in the Gentoo forums for advice on writing better ebuilds
